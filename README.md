# StudyBud

A social media styled platform for sharing education resources.

## Development Roadmap

June 2025

- [ ] Implement a feed containing recently shared files
- [ ] Implement email+pw signup and login
- [ ] Implement SSO using Google, GitHub and other platforms (TBD)
- [ ] Implement a locally running torrent server for file sharing
- [ ] TBC.

## Implementation

StudyBud leverages the convenience and speed of torrenting software eg qBitorrent. By using user computers to store files and only storing .torrent files on a server, the platform can significantly reduce the amount of traffic to the main website's servers and cut costs significantly by moving all file storage to the users.

Benefits that also come from this include faster download speeds, the ability to download files even if main servers go down and the lack of reliance on a central data source or third-party source / CDN.

## Our Motto

Knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone. No exceptions.

## Contribution

If you would like to contribute, please fork this repo and make pull requests to it. The owners will decide if your changes get included (or may provide you with some changes to make first).

The general guidelines are the basics really..

- KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
- Brackets on the same lines as functions
- Don't comment out code, just delete it. We use Git for a reason
- Be logical with your comments, no need for a whole narrative. Funny ones are allowed though.
- Swearing is ok, it probably means you know what you're doing

On the topic of knowing what you're doing:

I (hi it's Seamus talking now) personally believe that if you can only code with AI, you can't code, but you can prompt. I have nothing against people who want to help and try to vibe-code solutions, but keep this in mind.

If you create a PR that is looks suspiscious or *reaks* of AI, don't be surprised if we ask you how it works.

**If you can't explain, it doesn't get put in our codebase.** Simple ain't it?

Why? Well I'm glad you (probably) asked.

The code we maintain needs to stay at some standard, using AI makes that much harder. I'm not saying all AI code is bad, but at least know what it does before shovelling thousands of lines our direction. Smaller, more meaningful PRs are *way* more likely to be merged sooner and generally cause less problems when merging too!

## Thanks
